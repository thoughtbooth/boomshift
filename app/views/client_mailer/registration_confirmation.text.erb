Hi <%= @client.full_name %>,

I've added you as a client for my business (<%= @user.business.name %>) on Boomshift, 
an app that I use to run my business.  I would like to use Boomshift to communicate with you via email, 
but first you need to confirm your email address by clicking on the link below.

<%= confirm_email_client_url(@client.confirm_token) %>

Thanks,

<%= @user.full_name %>
<%= @user.business.name %>
<%= @user.business.phone %>
